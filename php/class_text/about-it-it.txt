<p>SnapSects is an interactive web/mobile application designed to make pictures of arthropods accessible to people who are blind or have low vision through Scientific Audio Description. It is a tool for scientific classification of arthropods, specially insects, and an educational asset for learning about biodiversity and the visual anatomical aspects or the external morphology of those organisms.</p> 



<p>SnapSects relies on users` volunteering contributions by means of taking and submitting pictures of arthropods, making audio description of them, revising scientific contents and edit proofing the site`s texts. </p>





<p>SnapSects was developed after a 2017 post-doctorial research at the Department of Entomology of the Museum of Natural History - Smithsonian Institution (United States), with a grant from the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior - CAPES (Brazil) and it is in compliance with best practices of accessibility and Audio Description.</p>
