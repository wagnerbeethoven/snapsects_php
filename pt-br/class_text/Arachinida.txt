<center><h2>About the class Arachnida</h2></center>

<p align="justify">The Arachnida belong to the subphylum Chelicerata. Some of the most common examples of arachnids are ticks, spiders, scorpions and mites. Like all arthropods, arachnids have a bilaterally symmetrical body, articulated appendages and exoskeleton ecdysis.  They are characterized by having chelicerae (instead of mandibles), a pair of pedipalps in the oral region and four pairs of legs in the cephalothorax. Their body is divided into the cephalothorax and abdomen. The cephalic region features simple eyes, which vary in numbers depending on the group, and it has chelicerae and pedipalps, which compose their oral apparatus. The thoracic region presents four pairs of legs. The abdomen usually houses the reproductive and defense structures, and shows variation in appearance. For example, the spider's abdomen is oval and shows spinners in the posterior-ventral region, whereas the scorpionâ€™s abdomen is elongated (it has a tail aspect), with a stinger in the last abdominal segment.</p>
