<center><h2>About the class Chilopoda</h2></center>

<p align="justify">The Class Chilopoda belongs to the subphylum Myriapoda and is commonly referred to as centipedes. Like other arthropods, they have an exoskeleton and articulated legs. The chilopods’ appendages are uniramous.
Chilopods differ from other arthropods because their bodies are divided into two main parts: head and trunk. The trunk is composed of thorax and abdomen. Dorsolaterally on the anterior part of the head there is a pair of antennae (with variable numbers of segments), and dorsolaterally near the middle of the head there is a pair of simple eyes. Ventrally on the anterior part of the head are the mouthparts, which are composed of a pair of mandibles and two pairs of maxillae. The thorax of the chilopods consists of 15 to 193 segments, and each segment has a pair of hinged legs. The first pair of legs has venom claws and the last pair of legs extends behind the body.
