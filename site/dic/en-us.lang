<center><h2>ARTHROPODA</h2></center><br><p align="justify">The phylum Arthropoda is part of the Animalia kingdom and covers the largest variety of species on the planet. Insects, crustaceans, arachnids, diplopods and chilopods belong to this phylum. Arthropods, invertebrate animals, are characterized by a rigid and chitinous exoskeleton, segmented body, bilateral symmetry and articulated legs. In general, the arthropods body consists of head, thorax and abdomen. In some cases, however, head and thorax are classified as cephalothorax, because they are united. In these cases, the arthropods body is divided into cephalothorax and abdomen. Although they have similar characteristics, arthropods are very diversified. They may have so different morphological characteristics that, in the eyes of the layman, they will not look like they belong to the same group. For example, shrimp and crabs are decapods and belong to the subphylum Crustacea. Similarly, spiders and scorpions are arachnids, belonging to the subphylum Chelicerata.</p>

<center><h2>About the class Arachnida</h2></center><p align="justify">The Arachnida belong to the subphylum Chelicerata. Some of the most common examples of arachnids are ticks, spiders, scorpions and mites. Like all arthropods, arachnids have a bilaterally symmetrical body, articulated appendages and exoskeleton ecdysis.  They are characterized by having chelicerae (instead of mandibles), a pair of pedipalps in the oral region and four pairs of legs in the cephalothorax. Their body is divided into the cephalothorax and abdomen. The cephalic region features simple eyes, which vary in numbers depending on the group, and it has chelicerae and pedipalps, which compose their oral apparatus. The thoracic region presents four pairs of legs. The abdomen usually houses the reproductive and defense structures, and shows variation in appearance. For example, the spider's abdomen is oval and shows spinners in the posterior-ventral region, whereas the scorpion’s abdomen is elongated (it has a tail aspect), with a stinger in the last abdominal segment.</p>
[231]
<center><h2>About the class Chilopoda</h2></center><p align="justify">The Class Chilopoda belongs to the subphylum Myriapoda and is commonly referred to as centipedes. Like other arthropods, they have an exoskeleton and articulated legs. The chilopods’ appendages are uniramous. Chilopods differ from other arthropods because their bodies are divided into two main parts: head and trunk. The trunk is composed of thorax and abdomen. Dorsolaterally on the anterior part of the head there is a pair of antennae (with variable numbers of segments), and dorsolaterally near the middle of the head there is a pair of simple eyes. Ventrally on the anterior part of the head are the mouthparts, which are composed of a pair of mandibles and two pairs of maxillae. The thorax of the chilopods consists of 15 to 193 segments, and each segment has a pair of hinged legs. The first pair of legs has venom claws and the last pair of legs extends behind the body.<br>Reference. BRUSCA, R. C.; BRUSCA, G. J. Filo Arthropoda: Miriápodes (Centopéias, Milípedes e Afins).

[232]
<center><h2>About the class Diplopoda</h2></center><br><p align="justify">The class Diplopoda belongs to the subphylum Myriapoda and is commonly known as millipedes. The Diplopods are found in tropical environments and, like other arthropods, they have an exoskeleton, articulated legs and segmented bodies.<br>They are characterized by presenting two tagma, the head and the trunk (fused thorax and abdomen) which are homonymous and multisegmented.<br>The head of the diplopods features a pair of antennae on the front edge, a pair of simple eyes, laterally located on the posterior part of the head, and mouthparts composed of a pair of mandibles and maxillae. The thorax has 11 to 192 diplosegments (segments in pairs). In each of them, except for the first and last, there are two pairs of legs.<br>References<br>BRUSCA, R. C.; BRUSCA, G. J.

<center><h2>About the class Insecta</h2></center><p align="justify">The term insect has its origin in the Latin word “insectum” and it means animal of grooved body, or segmented body. The class Insecta comprises 70% of the animal species. Like other arthropods, insects have an exoskeleton, articulated legs and body symmetry. Some of the most commonly known insects are the bees, cockroaches, flies, crickets, butterflies and beetles.<br>Insects differ from other arthropods because their bodies are divided into three main parts: head, thorax and abdomen. On their head are a pair of antennae, the eyes and ocelli, and the external mouth parts. Their thorax has up to four wings dorsally, and it has six legs ventrally. On the abdomen are the genital structures. Some structures are only present or apparent in the adult life stage.<br>The insect antennae are in the frontal region of the head, and can be classified in types including: filiform (e.g., cockroach, cricket), setaceous (e.g., grasshopper), geniculate (e.g. ant), plumose (e.g. mosquito), clavate (e.g., butterfly), aristate (e.g., fly) and serrate (e.g., beetle).<br>Insects, in most cases, present a pair of compound eyes, located in the lateral part of the head; and many also present simple eyes or ocelli (usually three), located at the apex of the head.<br>The insects’ mouthparts can be put into different categories, according to the specialization that it presents, and it may be: chewer (e.g., cockroaches, cricket); chewer/defense (e.g., termite, ant); maxilla-sucker (e.g., butterfly); labium suckers (e.g., mosquitoes, cicadas, bedbugs and fleas); licking (e.g., bee). The insects’ thorax is divided into three segments: from front, anterior, to back, posterior, prothorax, mesothorax and metathorax. If four wings, two pairs, are present, the insect will be tetrapterous. In this case, the metathorax will feature the pair of forewings and the metathorax will bear the pair of hindwings. Some hindwings may look dumbbell-shaped and be atrophied. Dumbbell-shaped atrophied wings, haltere, are not functional for flying and are very difficult to be seen with naked eyes. Because of that, insects with haltere wings are thought to have only two wings, for example those that belong to the order  diptera, e.g., mosquitoes and flies.<br>Insects that have no wings are apterous or wingless.<br>Wings can be distinguished as: membranous (e.g., wasps), tegamina (e.g., crickets, locusts and cockroaches), elytra (e.g., beetles), hemelytra (e.g., bugs) and haltere (e.g., flies, mosquitoes). Some insects may have two types of wings – for example, a beetle will have a pair of elytra covering over a pair of membranous wings.<br>The insects’ legs have different characteristics, according to the function they carry out, and some insects will have more than one type of legs, for example a honey bee have six ambulatory legs, and the pair attached to the metathorax are used for cleaning and the prothorax legs are collectors. They can be: ambulatorial (e.g., bee), cursorial (e.g. ants); saltatorial (e.g. crickets and grasshoppers); raptorial (e.g. mantis); collector (e.g., bees); scansorial (e.g., lice), among others.<br>The abdomen of the insects is divided into six to twelve segments, usually contains  sensory and genital structures. The abdomen may be free (e.g. butterflies, bees), sessile (e.g. crickets) or pedunculated (e.g., ant, wasps).</p><br>References<br>GALLO, D. et al. (Orgs.). Entomologia Agrícola.

<center><h2>About the class Malacostraca</h2></center><br><p align="justify">The Class Malacostraca belongs to the subphylum Crustacea. Lobsters, crabs, shrimps, barnacles and woodlouse are some of the most common known examples.<br>The name crustacean, given to these arthropods, comes from the Latin "crusta" which means crust. In general, they are aquatic animals (e.g., lobsters and shrimps), or live in very wet land areas (e.g., the Isopods).<br>Crustaceans have segmented bodies (cephalothorax and abdomen) and articulated appendages. The Crustacean’s cephalic region features five or six segments, which include two pairs of antennae, a pair of eyes, usually pedunculated, and the mouthparts, which consists of a pair of mandibles and two pairs of maxillae. Most crustaceans have a cephalothorax covered by a carapace.<br>Crustacean breathe through their gills which are located in the thoracic region.  The thoracic region has eight segments, three pairs of maxillipeds in the anterior region and five pairs of legs, called pereopods in the posterior region. Crustaceans usually bear five pairs of legs in the abdomen which are called pleopods. In the last abdominal segments, the appendages are the uropods and the telson.</p>
