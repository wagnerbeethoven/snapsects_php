The Queens, the Workers (females) and the Drones (males) are broadly similar in appearance; their bodies are bilaterally symmetrical and are covered in short hairs, and are divided into a head, a thorax and an abdomen. Queens are 18-20 mm, adults workers are 10-15 mm and the drones are 15-17 mm long at maturity. Only the queens are fertile. The workers have longer wings than the drones. Workers and Queens have a stinger that is formed from modified ovipositor structures. In Workers, the sting is barbed and in the drones, the stinger is supplied with venom from glands in the abdomen. The drone bee is stout-bodied and has larger eyes and a broad abdomen. Apis mellifera is commonly known as the honey bee.

The body is divided into head and trunk.The head is dorsally convex and ventrally flattened. It bears a pair of eyes, laterally located on the posterior part of the head and it features a pair of small antennae on the front edge. In the ventral region of the head, mouthparts are formed by a labrum on the upper part, a pair of mandibles with teeth, arranged laterally, and a pair of maxillae (gnatoquilário). The lateral margins of the head are covered by large mandibles. The maxillae form a squat, flattened plaque which are attached to the posterior-ventral surface of the head.The trunk (thorax and abdomen) is cylindrical, consisting of around 50 diplosegments (segments joined in pairs), with two pairs of legs on each segment, except the first and last segment. The first segment of the trunk is modified in a collar that connects the head and the trunk. On the seventh trunk segment, two pairs of legs are modified in gonopods, copulating organs.Legs are divided from basal to apical as: coxa, arthrodial membrane, trochanter, pre-femur, femur, tibia, first tarsus and second tarsus.","2017-12-21 17:44:19","","","","","","","pictures/Louse(Brachyiulus_pusillus).jpg","","","");#|#INSERT INTO snapsect VALUES("7","0","4","SnapSects team","snapsects@audiodescriptionworldwide.com","http://audiodescriptionworldwide.com","Photography: Karie Darrow (NMNH)","Chigger flea or Sand flea","Tunga penetrans","Animalia","Arthropoda","Insecta","Siphonaptera","Tungidae","Tunga ","Tunga penetrans","unknown","","","The head is angular.","The thoracic segments are narrow at the top.","The abdomen is enormously enlarged ","","","","","","Aptera (no wings)","","6","Aptera (no hind wings)","","Saltatorial","","","","","","","","","<link=http://www.icb.usp.br/~marcelcp/Tungapenetrans.htm>","|8|","Linnaeus (1758)","Waiting for contribution.

The centipede Scolopendra gigantea has a very sclerotized exoskeleton, which supports their body, has antennae which act as sensors to detect and locate prey, and has simple eyes called ocelli, whose function is to detect sources of light and movement.The centipedes thorax and abdomen are fused as a single structure known as a 	runk, which provides flexibility to the body.The centipede Scolopendra gigantea has long legs that allow them to run quickly on the ground. Their first pair of legs are called forcipules, which are located on the first segment of the trunk, just behind the head; these fanglike structures have venom glands which are used for defense, capture and laceration of prey.","The Scolopendra gigantea has an elongated body, measuring around 30 cm in length and is usually brown. Their body divides into head and trunk.The head bears a pair of ocelli, located dorsolaterally near the middle of the head. In the frontal margin of the head there are a pair of long antennae and the chewing mouth parts (located towards the ventral region of the head) which are composed of a labrum, a pair of laterally arranged mandibles, and a labium. The labrum extends down over the mandibles, just as our upper lip covers our teeth.  The labium is formed by two maxillae.  The first pair of maxillae is small and short and the second pair of maxillae is elongated, and accompanies the lower mandibles margin.The trunk (thorax and abdomen) consists of 21 segments covered by tergites (dorsal plates) and sternites (ventral plates). In the first trunk segment there is a pair of legs, modified as forcipules (maxillipeds) with large fangs. The forcipules curl towards the ventral midline of the trunk and extend to the front of the mouthparts. In the last segment of the trunk, a pair of legs projects toward the posterior of the body region.In each trunk segment, there is a pair of long legs arranged antero-laterally. Legs are divided from basal to apical part in: coxa, arthrodial membrane, trochanter, pre-femur, femur, tibia, first tarsus and second tarsus.","2017-12-20 02:59:11","","","","","","","pictures/Centipede(Scolopendra_gigantea_).jpg","","","");#|#INSERT INTO snapsect VALUES("25","0","4","SnapSects team","snapsects@audiodescriptionworldwide.com","http://audiodescriptionworldwide.com","Photography: Karie Darrow (NMNH)","German wasp","Vespula germanica ","Animalia","Arthropoda","Insecta","Hymenoptera","Vespidae","Vespula ","Vespula germanica ","female","V. germanica is marked with bold black and yellow bands.

It measures around 0.3 mm in length and is divided into the cephalothorax and abdomen. The cephalothorax and other segments are attached to the abdomen a single piece.From a dorsal view, the cephalothorax shows what looks like a shield or an oval-shaped plate. In the anterior region of the cephalothorax (cephalic region) there is a pair of simple eyes, located laterally.In the mouthparts there is a single structure called capitulum (gnathosoma), which is formed by the base of the capitulum, the hypostomium, the chelicerae and the palps.  The capitulum has a hexagonal outline.  Above the base of the capitulum there are palps laterally located.  The palps form two elongated structures where the chelicerae are located, and below the chelicerae lies the hypostomium.In the cephalothorax posterior region (thoracic region), there are four pairs of legs arranged ventro-laterally. They can be divided basal to distal as: coxa, trochanter, femur, patella, tibia, metatarsus, tarsus and claw.The abdomen is attached to the cephalothorax and has a tear-like rounded shape.

It is cylindrical and about 1/4 cm long. The thorax has more hair than head. Where the wings are attached, the thorax has more furry hair.","Connecting to the thorax is the abdomen.   The abdomen is longest part of the body. It’s cylindrical in shape about three times as long as the thorax and about the same width. The abdomen shrinks when butterflies donate their body to science. The photo shows thinner abdomen than a live one.

The antennae have very fine short hair all pointing away from the head.","The butterfly has two large round compound eyes that can be seen from the dorsal view. The eyes are positioned on the sides of their head. ","Siphoning","The butterfly uses a straw like mouth part called the proboscis to drink nectar from flowers or fruits. The proboscis is on the underside of the butterfly’s head. ","Scaly","There are four paper-thin lightweight wings. The wings have smooth edges and very short fine hair around the edges. Thicker hair is found in the hindwing on the back edge. The wings are symmetrical with two forewings and two hindwings. The forewings and hindwings only overlap about 2mm in this preparation. All wings are covered in microscopic scales on both sides, making the wings opaque and matte. The scales have different colors, giving the butterfly wings a visual pattern. This color description will describe the inside of the wings. This butterfly has black, yellow, and light orange sections in their wings. To give the wings structure, there are veins that run from the base to the tip of the wings. Veins are thin, black, and shiny. They appear same on both sides of the wings. The veins start thickest and closest to each other near the wing attachment site on the thorax. They branch as they get thinner and further from each other towards the tip. At the base, there are 4 branches of the veins. At the wing tip, there are 12 and 9 veins for the forewing and hindwing respectively.  The color is mostly black with some light yellow spots the yellow spots are prominently found between the second and fourth veins. Inside the heart thats made by the second and third vein that yellow shape is interrupted by one black line diagonally down into the outside of the week theres another yellow section about a third of the way in the outer edge and its about half millimeter wide the main yellow sections closers the body are about 1 1/4 cm wide. The two forewings form a triangular shape and larger than the hind wings. Longest segment of the triangle is the front edge, about 2.5cm. Second longest segment is the back edge, little less than 2cm. Shortest segment is the side edge, about 1.6cm. The wing veins start at the base of the wing nearest insect and it immediately splits into four veins.  The veins travel away from the body towards the tip and diverge further. The first vein closest to the front edge forms a single vein until it reaches the edge of the wing.  The second and third veins travel at slightly an upward angle as they diverge. As the veins near the middle of the wing about 1 cm from the wing attachment, they turn in towards each other and make an angular, elongated heart shape. From the top section of the heart, seven veins arise and run mostly parallel until they reach the edge of the wing. The second vein from the front that arises from the top of the heart shape splits further and gives off three more branches that travel to the front edge of the forewing.","6","Scaly","The two hindwings compared to the forewings are smaller, more rounded, and have a kite shape with round corners.  Similar to the forewings, all the veins of the wings arise where the wings are attached to that thorax.  The veins grow smaller as they travel farther away from the body. The veins first split into three segments.  The first segment is very short. It makes a small arch that travels forward and outside and rejoins the second vein. The second vein splits immediately and gives off a second branch right before the first vein is joined. The third vein is skinnier than the second vein and splits immediately in a narrow V shape.  The two branches of the third vein travels near the back edge of the hind wings. The second vein travels similarly to the second and third vein in the forewing. They converge to form a heart shape.  Six veins that are almost parallel arise from the top section of the heart shape and smaller veins travel towards the edge.   The butterfly is mostly black/dark brown with light yellow and light orange sections. The outer 2-3mm of the wings are mostly black or dark brown. In the forewing, yellow sections appear inside the heart shape and in between the parallel veins that arise from the top section of the heart-shaped venation patterns. The light yellow band is about 0.5cm wide and travels in a diagonal where the front section is closer to the body than the back section.  There is prominent yellow section between the third and fourth veins.  The hindwing is mostly dark brown/orange. The dark brown is found most prominently in the outer edge of the wings, creating a rounded frame for the orange. About 75% of the hindwing is yellow with small sawtooth markings of brown where the two colors meet about 0.25cm from the wings edge.

There are also a pair of compound eyes on the lateral front of the head and [#] ocelli in the frontal region. The chewing mouthparts are on the lower region of the head. The mouth features a labrum, which has a triangular shape, a pair of mandibles arranged laterally to the labrum, and a lower labium, with two short labial palps, one on each side. Laterally to the lower labium is a pair of long maxillae palpates, which are hinged forward. Periplaneta americana mandibles are strong and used to bite, dig, feed offspring and defend against predators.The thorax of Periplaneta americana consists of the prothorax, attached to the head; the mesothorax, the intermediate part; and the metathorax, attached to the abdomen. There are four wings located on the thorax of this cockroach, used to make short flights. The forewings are attached to the mesothorax, are the tegmina type. They are leathery, narrow and elongated. The hind wings, attached to the metathorax, are membranous. Each thoracic segment has a pair of ambulatory legs. The legs are divided from basal to distal in: coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia, tarsus and pre-tarsi. The femur has one lateral row of mechanosensory tactile spines (French and Sanders, 1981) and the tibia has two rows of lateral spines. </p>","<p align=justify>This portrait color photograph displays a dorsal view of the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana. This cockroach has an oval body which is dorsoventrally flattened. This specimen is about 27-35 mm in length and is reddish brown. Its body is divided into head, thorax and abdomen and it is bilaterally symmetrical. Its head is short, with a generally triangular shape, directed downwards. In the middle frontal region of the head, there are two filiform antennae. They contain three segments: attached to the head is a small segment called the scape. Distally connected to it is the pedicel which links to the flagellum, made of many segments. The antennae look thread-like, and they are longer than the body. Located laterally on the head is a pair of compound eyes. In the frontal region are the ocelli above the antenna. The mouthparts, located on the lower portion of the head, are of the chewing type. The mouth features a labrum, which has a triangular shape, a pair of mandibles arranged laterally to the labrum, and a lower labium, with two short labial palps, one on each side. Laterally to the lower labium is a pair of long maxillae palpates, which are hinged forward.The thorax bears the pronotum, which extends forward and covers the head. Directly behind the pronotum of the American cockroach is a pair of tegmina forewings. They are leathery, narrow and elongated. The forewings conceal a pair of membranous hindwings, as well as most of the abdomen. Ventral-laterally on each of the three segments of the thorax is a symmetrical pair of long, slender ambulatory legs. They are divided from basal to distal as: coxa, trochanter, femur, tibia, tarsus and pre-tarsi. The femur has one lateral row of mechanosensory tactile spines and the tibia has two rows of lateral spines.The sessile abdomen is covered by the wings, obscuring the ten segments and the pair of large, many-segmented cerci on either side of the posterior end of the abdomen. . </p>","2018-06-23 12:42:42","","","","","","","pictures/American_cockroach(Periplaneta_americana).png","","","");#|#INSERT INTO snapsect VALUES("45","0","4","SnapSects team","snapsects@audiodescriptionworldwide.com","http://audiodescriptionworldwide.com","Photography: Karie Darrow (NMNH)","Stink bug","Apateticus bracteatus ","Animalia","Arthropoda","Insecta","Hemiptera","Pentatomidae","Apateticus","Apateticus bracteatus ","female","","","","","","","","","Sucking-labial","","Hemielytra","","6","Membranous","","Ambulatorial","","","","","Adult","Incomplete","","","","|8|","Fitch (1856)","","","","2017-12-23 01:57:40","","","","","","","pictures/Stink_bug(Apateticus_bracteatus_)1.png","","","");#|#INSERT INTO snapsect VALUES("46","0","7","SnapSects team","snapsects@audiodescriptionworldwide.com","http://audiodescriptionworldwide.com","Photography: Karie Darrow (NMNH)","Desert leafcutting ant","Acromyrmex versicolor","Animalia","Arthropoda","Insecta","Hymenoptera","Formicidae","Acromyrmex ","Acromyrmex versicolor","unknown","","","","","","Geniculate","","","Chewing","","Aptera (no wings)","","6","Aptera (no hind wings)","","Ambulatorial","","","","","Adult","","","","","|4||8|","Pergande (1894)","Waiting for contribution.
